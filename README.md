# The Application

A single page web application written in React.

It should be fairly complex and include a variety of modern development techniques.

I have struggles creating and sharing relevant writing, creating and managing projects adequately.

The plan is to keep going step by step. The goal is to create a minimal viable product at every step. Instead of adding code that doesn’t do real work, we’re going to add code that provide immediate value to the functionality of the application.

Given the previous statement about adding functional code, it’s difficult for me to get started working on this application because I have no idea what application it will be. All I know is that I want to create a real world single page application but don’t know what problems it will solve. A firm beginning would be having even a simple idea of a problem to solve like task management or color picker etc. But I don’t have a clue where to start yet. All I know is I want to write more code and more plain old words on paper to share my ideas about the application.

## Authentication

To preserve settings, history, and create more powerful workflows users are able to sign up and sign in into the application.
