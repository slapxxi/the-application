# Features

First, we need to come up with an idea for the application. I don’t know what it’s going to do yet but there’s a set of requirements that should be met. For instance, the application should be hosted, performant, and as close to real world as possible without spending too much time on development.

We need to discover inspiration for this project to start implementing real world features as soon as possible. We’re particularly interested in beautiful functional UIs that solve problems of a typical user. There are some areas that could be interesting to work with:

- Project management app. It should be more advanced than your typical todo application to enable management of big projects with multiple users.
- Freelance Network. Too huge for a single developer like me.
- Application for frontend developers that allows to authenticate via Github and provides useful integration to find a dream job.

Interestingly, developing a freelance network for developers seems quite promising and interesting at the same time. It’s a huge endeavor for sure but it is also a huge learning opportunity. From creating great user experience to providing features competitors don’t have, a variety of knowledge to gain is astounding.

## Motivation

Employers look for particular roles to be filled in their teams. For example, an employer could look for a frontend developer. We identify a frontend developer as a role an employer is looking for. Furthermore, any role has a particular skillset associated with it. Exact skills may vary from an employer to employer. Therefore, we provide an ability to specify a set of skills an employer expects from a particular role.

When a freelancer matches the requirements of the employer, he gets a notification with a potential job opportunity.

The main focus of this application is on developers looking for a part time gig or a full time job.

## Search

Search is arguably the most important part of any kind of network, especially a network of people looking for other particular people.

## Resumé

Users can format and present information about their skills, experience and goals in a memorable, interesting way that appeals to potential customers.

## Authentication

Almost any application needs some kind of authentication mechanism implemented. The application is no exception. We use third party services such as Github to implement simple and effective authentication.Download
