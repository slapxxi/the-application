First, I need to come up with an idea for the application. I don’t know what it’s going to do yet but there’s a set of requirements that should be met. For instance, the application should be hosted, performant, and as close to real world as possible without spending too much time on development.

We need to discover inspiration for this project to start implementing real world features as soon as possible. We’re particularly interested in beautiful functional UIs that solve problems of a typical user. There are some areas that could be interesting to work with:

- Project management app. It should be more advanced than your typical todo application to enable management of big projects with multiple users.
- Music player? Nah.
- Freelance Network. Too huge for a single developer like me.
