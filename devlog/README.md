# Development Log

- [ ] Create a login page with the corresponding acceptance tests

The point of this document is to explain changes occurring in the codebase over time. The whole point of this folder is to keep me organized and thinking about this project in terms of writing.

The general rule of thumb is to not change important parts of the codebase without explaining it here first.

More on testing could be found in [“Testing”](Testing.md).

I could see how information present here could become outdated fast. So, we need to come up with a way to make it resilient to frequent changes.

Every file describing an area of responsibilities has a list of the most important tasks at the top with the first task on the list being addressed next. That allows us to clearly see what’s next on our radar and start implementing it. We could also use the issue tracker provided by Github to manage tasks but it’s platform dependent. That is, if we decide to migrate from Github or ditch it altogether the development history will not be preserved.

More on the features available can be found in [“Features”](features/README.md).
