# Development Log

Here we document decisions regarding design and development of the application, explore ideas, record problems occurring during development and just write down our thoughts. Doing it will help us become better developers by inspecting our thoughts and decision making process.

Most of the time the development log is quite raw, meaning it contains unpolished writing with a number of mistakes. However, the main point of keeping the log is not to write perfectly, but to discover ideas and to document the process of development. The rule of thumb is not to commit important changes to the application repository without explaining it here.

Here I also keep track of the long term and short term tasks. They usually appear at the top of the documents, sorted by priority.

There are the following sections:

- [“Features”](Features.md) describes features of the application and the process of their development.
- [“Workflow”](Workflow.md) describes how we organize our work to remain productive.
- [“Architecture”](Architecture.md) describes how we build the application so it’s easy to maintain and extend. In addition, it’s where we describe technology and architecture choices.
